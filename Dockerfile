# Multiâ€‘stage build for Redshot backend and frontend

# -------- Stage 1: build the React frontend --------

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only package files first to leverage npm cache
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/package-lock.json* ./frontend/
WORKDIR /app/frontend
RUN npm install && \
    # Ensure the Vite binary has execute permissions.  On some platforms
    # (notably Alpine), npm may install Vite without the executable bit
    # set, which results in a "Permission denied" error when running
    # the build script.  Adjusting permissions here avoids that issue.
    chmod +x node_modules/.bin/vite

# Copy the rest of the frontend source and build
COPY frontend/ ./
# Build the React frontend.  We invoke Vite via `npm exec` rather than
# relying on the npm script directly, because the latter can fail if the
# underlying binary lacks execute permission.  `npm exec vite build`
# explicitly resolves the correct Vite binary within node_modules and
# executes it with the appropriate Node interpreter.
RUN npm exec vite build

# -------- Stage 2: build the Python backend --------
FROM python:3.10-slim AS backend

WORKDIR /app

# Create a directory for persistent data (e.g. the SQLite database).  Declaring
# this as a volume allows the database to survive container restarts when the
# user mounts a host directory or a named volume to `/app/data`.
RUN mkdir -p /app/data
VOLUME ["/app/data"]
