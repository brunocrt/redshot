Orchestration and supervision for the Redshot system.

The **System Supervisor** ties together all other components.  It manages
communication between the portfolio manager, asset advisor, market researcher
and trade broker.  In a production deployment this component would also
handle scheduling, health checks, error reporting and persistence.  Here we
provide a simple synchronous loop for demonstration purposes.
